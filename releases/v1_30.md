### Important!

#### A+
* Requires courses to be built with the new **a-plus-rst-tools** v2.0.0.
* Due to updates to [python-grader-utils](https://github.com/apluslms/python-grader-utils), course staff needs to update the [grade-python](https://github.com/apluslms/grade-python/tree/3.13-5.0-4.13) container image in each exercise that uses **python-grader-utils**, to one of the versions listed below, depending on which flavour is being used.

    If the grading command (see example below) is not `graderutils`, i.e., **python-grader-utils** is not used, changes are not needed, but the image can still be updated if desirable.

    New container images:
    ```
    3.13-5.0-4.13
    math-3.13-5.0-4.13
    rdf-3.13-5.0-4.13
    xls-3.13-5.0-4.13
    y2-3.13-5.0-4.13
    ml-3.13-5.0-4.13
    ply-3.13-5.0-4.13
    jupyter-3.13-5.0-4.13
    smt-3.13-5.0-4.13
    mec-3.13-5.0-4.13
    psql-3.13-5.0-4.13
    comp-3.13-5.0-4.13
    ```

    Example of an outdated `config.yaml` that needs to be updated:
    ```yaml
    container:
        image: apluslms/grade-python:3.9-4.5-4.3
        mount: exercises/1
        cmd: graderutils
    ```

    Updated `config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    container:
        image: apluslms/grade-python:3.13-5.0-4.13
        mount: exercises/1
        cmd: graderutils
    ```
* In order to test a course locally, update the `plus` and `grader` services' container images to the latest version in `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    plus:
        image: apluslms/run-aplus-front:1.30
    ...
    grader:
        image: apluslms/run-mooc-grader:1.30
    ```

* Dark theme specific custom CSS styles can be added by using, e.g.:
    ```css
    [data-bs-theme=dark] h2 {
        color: white;
    }
    ```

#### a-plus-rst-tools
* For older A+ versions (<=1.29), Bootstrap 3 backwards compatibility can be toggled with the following `conf.py` setting:
    ```python
    html_theme = 'aplus_bs3'
    ```
