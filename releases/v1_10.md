# A+ v1.10 Release Notes

August 2021

## A+ v1.10.0

* [A+ v1.10](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
* [MOOC-Grader v1.10](https://github.com/apluslms/mooc-grader/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
* [a-plus-rst-tools v1.4](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus-rst-tools/releases/tag/v1.4)

### Visible changes

* Enrollment roles and statuses
  - Ability for course staff to remove and ban students from the course by using the Participants page. Removed students can re-enroll if they want, banned students can't.
  - The Participants page also lists removed and banned students, and the table can be filtered by status.
  - ~~Students can unenrol (remove) themselves from the course, by using the Unenrol option in the left sidebar.~~ Self-unenrolment was withdrawn because unenrolling in the end of the course would cause issues.
  - Each instance of a course can now have different teachers. The teachers and assistants of the course instance can be changed on the course tab of the course editor. The Teachers tab has been removed.
  - The All results page, as well as Course points and other API views that return exercise result data, no longer list course staff.
* Updates in "All results" view (course points page)
  - The columns are rearranged to better match the SISU import format (CSV is generated based on the table). There is "SISU format" button that sets up the column ordering to match the same format SISU requires. It includes fields for grade, assessment date, completion language, that are not currently used by A+, but teacher can fill these after CSV export (e.g., using Excel), and then further move the information to SISU.
  - Results view shows student organization, that can be also used as filtering criteria. Students may log in with Haka using their home university account, so this allows separation of results based on home university.
* Improvements of texts and translations in the user interface
  - Includes some changes in terminology, most prominent being "exercise" → "assignment"
  - English texts are changed to British English to be more consistent with other Aalto services (e.g., enroll → enrol; enrollment → enrolment; color → colour)
  - Form labels are improved and translations for labels are provided
* Haka-login can be disabled from local settings
* Add a link to the new feedback form in the A+ site footer.
* Questionnaire feedback no longer uses italic font. Thus, the teacher may write feedback that emphasizes certain parts of the feedback with the italic font.
* [Python-grader-utils v4](https://github.com/apluslms/python-grader-utils/releases/tag/v4.0) and the new `apluslms/grade-python:3.7-4.0-3.5` grading container
  - Added IOTester for input/output-based testing
  - Added rpyc remote grader. It runs the grader and student's submission in different processes. It is still possible to run a single process like previously.

### Under-the-hood changes

These should be interesting only to developers, and (hopefully) not affect the life of regular users.

* Upgrade to Django 3.2 (for a-plus)
* Translation method is redesigned. Now also English texts are in localization files, and replaced by identifiers in code
* Add a new API endpoint for retrieving the course news.
