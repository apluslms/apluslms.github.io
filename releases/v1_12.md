# A+ v1.12 Pre-Release Notes

Planned release: December 2021

### Planned changes (in rough order of implementation priority)

Here is our current plan of features implemented for next A+ release. These are listed in rough order of priority: features towards the bottom of the list are implemented only after the prior onece. These plans and priorities may yet change, and community input is welcome, e.g., regarding priorization of features.

In addition, we are aware of suspected issues in occasional poor performance assignment submission feedback. This and other possibly detected bugs will be fixed ASAP prior to v1.12 as patch releases as soon as we have a fix available.

* Divide bulding courses with Gitmanager and grading exercises with MOOC-Grader in separate components
* Mass regrading of submissions, e.g. after grading failure or detected error in grading code
* Improved detection of submission failures and automatic timer-based retry of failed submissions
* Improved user interface and performance improvements of deadline deviations view
* Adding course instances semi-automatically from Sisu, automatic enrollment of students from Sisu

If time persists after previous modifications, otherwise these go to v1.13:
* Improving performance and usability of the course participants view
* Improving performance and usability of the results view

Most likely in v1.13, unless other features complete fast:
* Choosing random assignments from preconfigured task pools
