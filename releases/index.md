# Releases

A release is a bit vague term for A+ LMS and it is more there to set dates and to help talking about set of features.
This is because of the fact that A+ LMS is a family of services (check [architecture](/architecture/)), instead of a single application.
A+ LMS services have their own releases, though those can be synchronized with dates described here.

## Release Schedule

New versions of [core components](/components/#core) are released two times a year.
The first release is at the start of January and the second at the start of June.
Features are frozen a few weeks before releases,
that is, in November and May.
Only bug fixes are accepted during a feature freeze,
so develop and provide a pull request for a feature early.

So, yearly cycle:

* May - Feature freeze for a summer release
* June - A summer release
* November - Feature freeze for a winter release
* January - A winter release
