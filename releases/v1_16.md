* [MOOC-Grader v1.16.0](https://github.com/apluslms/mooc-grader/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

  (No changes since A+ v1.15)


### Major changes

* Assignments embedded in chapters warn the student when
  he/she tries to submit an identical solution to the existing submissions
  ([#1006](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1006)).
* Redesigned the support page (in the A+ site footer).


### Minor changes:

* Automatic enrolling of course participants from Sisu begins 14 days
  prior to the course start (instead of only after the course start).
* Minor usability fixes for the course instance creation under
  the "Edit course - Instances" menu
  ([#1054](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1054),
  [#1056](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1056)).
  - [Updated demo video](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=30f10643-2714-4317-bc3b-aef6007f497b)
    about creating new course instances
* **MOOC-Grader**: added support for Scala3 REPL output in the `ignorerepl` modifier
  of questionnaire free-text questions
  ([#134](https://github.com/apluslms/mooc-grader/issues/134)).
* **Git Manager**:
  - Added validations to course configurations:
    + the course `unprotected_paths` setting may only serve files from the static directory
      ([#14](https://github.com/apluslms/gitmanager/issues/14))
    + module and course dates, e.g., opening time must be earlier than closing time
  - Fixed the name of the `read-open` field in the aplus-json output.


### For system administrators and developers:

* Updated the Django REST framework and DRF extensions packages.
* Added database table `PendingSubmission` for a new feature that
  will be released in a patch later
  ([#988](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/988)):
  automatic retries of incomplete grading jobs.


## A+ v1.16.1

* [A+ v1.16.1](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  - Fixed an issue that prevented making new submissions in assignments
    that do not include file uploads and are not questionnaires
    ([#1064](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1064)).
    In practice, the issue affected assignments that depend on
    custom frontend JavaScript code.


## A+ v1.16.2

* [A+ v1.16.2](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/releases/tag/v1.16.2)
  - Fixed an issue in the identical/duplicate submission check
    (PR [#1069](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/pull/1069)).  
    When a checkbox question in a questionnaire included multiple choices
    in the same question, the submission comparison was incorrectly based
    on only one selected checkbox instead of all the selected.


## A+ v1.16.x **(under development and subject to change)**

* **Automatic retries of incomplete grading jobs**:
  A+ tries to detect submissions that seem to be stuck in grading,
  in other words, submissions that haven't received the grading results
  from the assessment service.
  Those submissions are periodically automatically uploaded to grading again.
  ([#988](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/988))
* When the teacher creates new A+ course news items
  (that are shown in the course front page),
  the message may also be emailed to the course participants.
