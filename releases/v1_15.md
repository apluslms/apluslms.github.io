# A+ v1.15 Release Notes

June 2022 ([GitHub milestone](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/milestone/11?closed=1))

## A+ v1.15.0

* [A+ v1.15.0rc1](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/releases/tag/v1.15.0rc1)
* MOOC-Grader: latest version is [1.14.2](https://github.com/apluslms/mooc-grader/releases/tag/v1.14.2)
* [Git Manager v1.15.0rc1](https://github.com/apluslms/gitmanager/releases/tag/v1.15.0rc1)

### Changes / A+ front

* Teachers may easily create new A+ course instances themselves as self-service. ([issue #963](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/963))
  - There is no longer a need to request course instances from A+ administrators
    unless you need a new course space with a new course code and name.
  - The new teacher's user interface in A+ (under the Edit course section) creates
    the course instance in the Git Manager backend as well.
  - Teachers may modify typical Git Manager settings directly in A+.
    Therefore, teachers usually need not access the Git Manager web site separately.
  - [demo video](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c65fa197-d82a-4732-9503-ae710064f733)
* Experimental alternative API for getting course results (([issue #918](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/918)))
  - Recent versions of A+ have suffered from very poor performance of "All results" view, that in some cases has
    made it unusable. We implemented an experimental alternative of the API endpoint used by the view, to test its efficiency in production environment. This will be replaced by a finalized implementation later, so this
    API is temporary, and not intended to be used by external applications.
* New API endpoint for regrading submissions. ([issue #1008](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1008))
  - Course staff can re-submit an existing submission for grading through `/submissions/ID/resubmit` endpoint.
* Show hidden modules and exercises to teacher on "Your points" page ([issue #1012](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1012))
  - In particular, this makes enrollment questionnaires more visible.
* Clarify enrollment counts in the participants view.
  - The different enrollment statuses (active/banned/removed/pending) are shown more clearly than before.
* Remove possibility to sign in as another user. ([issue #1032](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1032))
* Add download button for model answers and templates. ([issue #894](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/894))
* Add button to user profile view to regenerate API access token. ([issue #1022](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1022))

### Bug fixes

* Fix enrollment questionnaire visibility with when SISU enrollment is in use. ([issue #1042](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/1042))
* Map static URLs in exercise descriptions to correct network location ([issue #974](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus/issues/974))
  - A+ has had a logic that maps relative URLs in exercise descriptions to the Grader server. However,
    after Gitmanager was introduced, the correct thing would be point to Gitmanager, which is now fixed.
    It is advised to use the `static_host` setting in conf.py, to generate proper full URLs. 

In addition, there are small coding style, documentation, etc. improvements
