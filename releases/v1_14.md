### Changes

* Added support for enrollment questionnaires when the course enrollments are retrieved from SIS.
  - Enrollments have a new PENDING status.
  - Students with a PENDING enrollment must complete the enrollment questionnaire before they may submit to assignments.
  - If SIS enrollment is not used, a PENDING enrollment is added
    when the student opens the enrollment questionnaire even if they do not submit it.
  - Background: enrollment questionnaires force the student to answer to a questionnaire
    before they may enroll in the A+ coursespace.
    Before v1.14, enrollment questionnaires were disabled when SIS enrollments were used in A+.
