**Some features planned for the v1.14.0 release have been delayed.**
They will be released in the patch v1.14.1 in late April 2022.

### Changes

* Added support for enrollment questionnaires when the course enrollments are retrieved from SIS.
  - Enrollments have a new PENDING status.
  - Students with a PENDING enrollment must complete the enrollment questionnaire before they may submit to assignments.
  - If SIS enrollment is not used, a PENDING enrollment is added
    when the student opens the enrollment questionnaire even if they do not submit it.
  - Background: enrollment questionnaires force the student to answer to a questionnaire
    before they may enroll in the A+ coursespace.
    Before v1.14, enrollment questionnaires were disabled when SIS enrollments were used in A+.


## A+ v1.14.1 (to be released in late April 2022)

### New features

* Teachers may easily create new A+ course instances themselves as self-service.
  - There is no longer a need to request course instances from A+ administrators
    unless you need a new coursespace with a new course code and name.
  - The new teacher's user interface in A+ (under the Edit course section) creates
    the course instance in the Git Manager backend as well.
  - Teachers may modify typical Git Manager settings directly in A+.
    Therefore, teachers usually need not access the Git Manager web site separately.

* Approval of late and unofficial submissions as normal, graded submissions.
  - If the course has enabled late and/or unofficial submissions,
    teachers may now approve such submissions and transform them into normal, graded submissions.
  - An approved submission is like any other normal submissions:
    it affects the grading and has no late penalty.
